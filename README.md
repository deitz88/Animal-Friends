<h1>Welcome to Animal Friends!</h1>
Just as much as us homans need to socialize and interace, so do our Furry Friends.<br />
So i decided to make this app, as a playdate finder for our furry companions.
My dog, Max, has changed my life, and so i found it fitting to make something on his behalf<br />
